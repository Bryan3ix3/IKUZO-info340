                    Overview
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Maintaining and improving physical and mental health can be a challenge for university students. As a student, I find it challenging to connect with people who share a similar interest in physical activity. Our group would like to create an information system to help connect students who have identical availability and interest in physical activities to help them better maintain their health.

                        <li>
                            A considerable number of university students have demonstrated desire and interest in maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Research published in James Clearâ€™s Atomic Habits suggests that people are more likely to sustain habits if those habits are also practiced by the many, the powerful (influencers) or the close (proximity). We have chosen to apply the latter strategy. By connecting students with similar goals, we aim to foster long-term habit formation.

                    Existing Solution Analysis
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Fitness web apps such as <a href="https://www.crossfit.com/">CrossFit</a>  and <a href="https://www.fitnessblender.com/">Fitness Blender</a> attempt to solve this problem; however, they focus on workout routines for people who go to the gym. In addition, these web apps include virtual fitness events and ways of finding local gyms nearby. But, they lack the aspects for community and local connections with other individuals. We want to solve this problem by incorporating a wide range of fitness opportunities for university students, apart from just going to the gym.

            <h2>Proposed Application</h2>
        
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Our intended audience for this application is university students, specifically those who attend UW.
                </li>
            </ul>
        
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Students using this site will view the profiles of other students who share a similar interest in physical activities. They will also find outdoor events on the home page. 
                </li>
            </ul>
        
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Students will be able to create their profiles and provide information such as: what sport they like, what times are they available, and any other interests/information they would like to provide to connect with fellow students. They will also be able to join events and send messages to their friends. 
                </li>
            </ul>
        
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Students who have a busy schedule or difficulty commuting to campus may have trouble connecting with other students to exercise with. This application will help connect students with the same interest in sports or physical activity to promote exercise.
